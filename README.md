<h1>Mersenne Primes</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Why 2<sup>n</sup>  -1    and not  3<sup>n</sup>– 1  or  4<sup>n</sup> -1   or 5<sup>n</sup>-1  or 6<sup>n</sup> -1 ?</li>

 <li>Are you a Maple or Matlab user?</li>

 <li>in Maple there is an <strong><em>ithprime</em></strong>       It returns the prime you specify.  For example  <em>ithprime(4)</em> returns the 4<sup>th</sup> prime,  which is 7.   <em>ithprime(i)</em>  returns the ith prime.</li>

 <li>in Matlab there is a <strong>primes</strong>  You give it a number and it returns all the primes up to that number,  a list.</li>

</ol>

So  <strong>primes(20)</strong>   returns all the primes up to 20  hence

2     3     5     7    11    13    17    19

Either way, you have something to work with.  Try yours out.

Here is your small research project:  <em>what percentage of primes do you think are also Mersenne primes? </em>

Use your software, do some research, come up with an estimate.  Provide that and what you based it on.  Two different people may well have different results.  That’s fine.




<ol start="3">

 <li>Can you find a Mersenne Prime where the exponent is itself a Mersenne prime? (we know the exponent must be prime from class)</li>

</ol>




<h1>Fibonacci</h1>

<ol start="4">

 <li>Get the Binet formula out. For the cases n=3 and 4, verify that you really do get  F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>4 </sub></li>

 <li>a) develop polynomial expressions for 1/φ ,  1/φ<sup>2</sup>, 1/φ<sup>3</sup>, 1/φ<sup>4</sup>,  and  1/φ<sup>5</sup></li>

</ol>

with simple algebra.  ( 1/φ   =  φ  – 1  , just to get your going)

<ol>

 <li>b) can you see a formula emerging for 1/φ<sup>n</sup>     ?</li>

</ol>
